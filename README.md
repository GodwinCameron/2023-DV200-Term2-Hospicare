## About the Project

### Project Description

Managing patients, doctors and booking appointments have never been easier! Now with the Hospicare interface you can have full PHP, MySQL and frontend design clashing to form this hospital manager.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For development, the latest version of xampp is required. The latest version can be downloaded from [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

### Installation

Here are a couple of ways to clone this repo:

1.  GitHub Desktop </br>
    Enter `https://github.com/GodwinCameron/2023-DV200-Term2-Hospicare.git` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

2.  Clone Repository </br>
    Run the following in the command-line to clone the project:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GodwinCameron/2023-DV200-Term2-Hospicare.git
    ```

3.  Files to XAMPP htdocs </br>
    After installing xampp, locate your htdocs folder by navigating to:

    ```sh
    C:/users/(you)/xampp/htdocs
    ```
4.  Transfer files and run </br>
    Move the contents of the repo into your own htdocs folder and you're ready to rock! Make sure you start up your xampp SQL and APACHE servers, head over to your browser of choice and navigate to "localhost/index.php"

## Features and Functionality

This app allows you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete patitents, receptionists, doctors, rooms and appointments. As well as showing you the appropriate data in all the relative locations. This PHP CRUD app was made to explore some of the concepts in industry today while also highlighting some security and operational concepts that have plagued PHP and SQL developers in the past.

## Concept Process

While exploring PHP and MySQL, we as students were tasked with creating a fully working system to manage medical practise related processes.

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

### Implementation Process

- I created a backend structure to house the data for the app of this scope, being sure to include all of the relivant parameters.

- Created a frontend to suppor the data that would be displayed dynamically

<!-- and used `module.scss` to style each individual component. An id get given to each classname, making the styling super easy -->

- I worked to merge the two in a seamless app, using PHP to dynamically generate HTML markup as well as data retrieved from SQL calls

<!-- edit, delete and send (CRUD) data to it -->


#### Highlights

- A very big high point was seeing the data from my backend being populated dynamically in my front-end.
- Gaining the knowledge and ability to manipulate my markup using PHP really made me feel like I was begining to understand the language.
- Taking calls from guides, online threads and class exercises and manipulating them to suit the functionality and look of the intended app withouth any futher guidance and understanding the syntax and parameters of my PHP calls to create my own
- Fixing troubling bugs after hours of trying to understand what the problem was only to finally solve it in the end and feeling the wave of relief and satisfaction


#### Challenges

- Understanding the syntax of PHP was one of my biggest challenges, knowing what each super global was representing and where the data was coming from took some time to grasp 

- Getting over looking at it from a JS perspective, after using JavaScript for so long, my mind naturally thinks of solutions that JS would solve, fighting that urge and leaning into PHP as my new tool for these endevours was a challenging mental gap to bridge.


### Future Implementation


Future functionality that I would hope to see come to this project.

- Syncing up data to flow from the appointments to the Google Calendar widget.

- Adding in unique super user assets that an admin could access and not any regular user.
